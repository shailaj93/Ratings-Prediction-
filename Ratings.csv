"This is a very good smartphone, especially for students.
It has a very good camera and software optimisation. It has a '50 megapixel' camera. So you can click wide range photos very well. It is also very good for clicking photos of handwritten assignments. Selfie camera is ok.
It has a 'Helio G85' processor. For people who don't no much about processor, this is a very powerful and decent processor. You can run 'BGMI' and some other heavy games like this in good graphics settings very well.

On the plus side it has a much brighter screen (500 plus units compared to Narzo 20) a slightly better main camera as it has 50 MP main lens with a dedicated depth senor for potrait mode

Pathetic phone. Very very slow. Unable to receive a call if you are using any application. It will display the caller details after a few seconds of ringing. Worst wifi adapter. You cannot focus a point touching once. Atleast you have to tap 4-5 times minimum. You cannot view the photo you clicked just now. For that you also have to tap for a few times and also it will take some time to display the photo. Touch is bogus. PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. It is just wastage of money. I am trying ...,1

But the user interface is not friendly at all, the charger received along with the mobile is the size of a fist, so when you put it in the socket it covers the surrounding switches due to its size, so you can't switch them on....very pathetic design. Even the phone interface has many probs, also if you click a photograph instead of it showing on top in gallery, it goes down at the bottom. I don't know why many are raving about it.",2

The keyboard is very easy to use and spacious. Track pad is good but the trackpad buttons sometimes need to be pressed 2-3 times to click.

Same goes for the power button, it never turns on in a single press. The power button light is also blue which for me is very difficult to notice. It should have been normal white light.

The look of the design is very good and the keyboard can be easily used at night due to backlight keyboard. Performance is also very good and it takes only 4-5 seconds to reboot.

Note: The only draw back in the 40inch version - doesn't have HDMI ARC like other models (32/43/55)
I wonder why this is not an option on this model.

The after-sales is also great. I got my TV installed by a guy named Sonu from Jeeves. He was highly professional and explained all the features of the TV.",5

Pros:
Remote solves all your needs.
Connectivity us good.
Almost all apps are pre-installed.
4k picture quality is damn good.

Con:
There is no 3.5 audio output to connect your TV into an old sound system; one needs to buy an optical cable and optical to analogue converter in order to utilise an existing stereo system. And it's costs you dearly...rs 3.5k to 6k.

"Write this review after using for a month. I could see now on screen called ""mura"" a kind of fault mostly found on LCD TV screen. This fault shows the quality of panels and standard of assemble processes. Now I want them to replace this TV but not sure would they do it or not.",2
"The installation technician didn't install in a proper way. They install their own panel but the panel is not fixed properly on the TV and wall.
Worst installation experience ever.",1
Nice. Compact tv.,5
"Pros:-
Good price.
Picture Quality is awesome.
Look & finish is most beautiful looking.
Connectivity is also good.
Interface is also great.


Cons:-
Sound quality is poor.

Most value for money product in 43 inch size compared to all brands.",4
"First of all ,product is coming with energy saving in picture mode.so screen shows dull when we start the tv. First neee to change picture settings to standard or other mode,the screen looks bright. HD quality is good. Sound is just stereo mode ,need to have home theater for watching movies . Connectivity is seamless both wifi and bluetooth.

Tv does not have IPS panel , if you want IPS then go for other",4
Wifi connectivity was very poor and Bluetooth remote not working properly.,2
Superb... Quality is great... Perfect.,5

"Just i would like to say under such price you are getting:-

1)A brand i.e, OnePlus.
2)Better picture quality provided that the connectivity is excellent.
3) Boder less design, which impersonate well itself.
4) Thick varients is also good.
5)Sound qualify is not much enough, for better experience you need to have sound theatre.

6)Thanx all from Alam.

"Team, Today only I received my product - 29, May, and below are pros and cons.

Good Point:
1. Very quick delivery
2. Better clarity compare to Mi and UV
3. Easy to handle and lightweight just 6 Kgs

Bad Points:
1. Not having AUX sound connectivity, it has Digital Optical Audio Output which is mostly not available with general sound system
2. difficult to share the mobile screen with this TV since OnePlus connect android App don't work on all mobiles
3. The Installation team will come after 8...",1
Bad quality.in 15 days so far display problem nd told me not replace tv. I told people not buying any electronics equipment from online.,1
"Within 4 months pitcher panal is not working properly, Engineer is come and check but last 10 days haven't received any response or solution, west of money, don't bye this product",1
My led tv picture suddenly off,1
"Recently I bought this tv...only one day it was worked,aftr that the display (picture was not displayed) was gone..I don't knw what happdn...I think it's not worthble yr",1
"This is sub standard TV. I have TCL TV purchased last yr. With same confirmation and clearly TCL is much much better.

Drawback..
1. Slow connectivity via wifi
2. USB. No last memory. Every time ull have forward which is very very slow
3. Picture clarity stands no where when compared with TCL
4. Screen cast/ mirroring is pathetic. It just keeps hanging.

Overall... its frustrating experience.

Go for TCL instead of One+",1
"Review after 9 months-
Black cloudy pattern on screen.

Poor customer support. I have following for last 2 months.

Don‚Äôt buy this product.",1
One plus to improve display panel quality...,1
"I am Changing my review almost after 11months of use as TV show sign of picture tube fading & even after 4complaints to customer care, no body shows up till now in more than 17days. Can see the sides of picture dosplay turning red & fading up.
Worst customer care service & worst after sale service. Will suggest not to buy one plus TVs at all if you want to save your hard earned money. Literally feeling cheated",1
Just amazing üëè,1
"TV quality is not a good, sound issues and TV is also hang many time Technics come and problem solve but next day problem re create....such a bad TV...I am really told you don't purchase this tv and don't waste your money for One+....Baddd",1
"Within 3 months of purchase, the display is gone. And its been 2 weeks since filing complaint under warranty, they have not been able to find & install new display. Don't recommend anyone to purchase this TV",1
Installation is an issue.,1
Automatically exit to home screen and off,1
"The worst tv everseen,, waste of time,, i would like to give my two suggestion to all
1)picture clarity of this tv is totally waste, myself giving input - movie 12GB size movie, but the output in the tv is 400mb movie size clarity,,
2) The speaker quality is really worst, voice clarity is as childish one having 5 to 7 years baby voice. Bluetooth speaker (cost may be Rs.250) is better than this tv spaeker. I request you to provide atleast Bluetooth spaeker quality,,, waste of money",1
It's very bad don't buy.... picture clarity worst very bad,1
Generally 1plus is a good brand but even at a price of 16k OnePlus cannot afford to give such third grade products. Probably they should take this product off from circulation. Such pathetic was the quality of this particular product. Am not sure about how is the performance of higher end products in OnePlus but this definitely is not something to consider at all.,1
Horrible product...unnatural colours... Most of the STB channels are blurr ..Picture quality is too bad...do not recommend this product to anyone ...complete waste of money,1
"Very poor display. It gives eye strains and headaches.
The colours looks faded and the sharpness is too high.
It is pinching to the eyes.
never expected such a poor product from 1+
Moreover the flipkart refuses to return it.
Be extremely cautious before buying.
I will not recommend it at all.
I feel like being cheated.",1

2. Battery backup is perfect
3. Call sound is perfect
4. design and build is very good",4
"It's just perfect!!
It's sound quality is perfect ...but bass is good .. not perfect...we can enjoy music with great sound of good bass...u can have a try on it...if it gets at low price rate .. and also it's touch controls are also good and accurate...well made... simply perfect...but it can be much better if it have that punchy bass ... overall a nice product...thank u",4
So Here we go the product design is awesome !! You can wear and do gym ! The calling feature is nice but as compare to boat its bass is not that good but u will be satisfied at this price the touching sensor is fast the battery backup is awesome...it would have been awesome if there would be more bass.. All over a good purchase at this price ! And yes at the last the case is so compact and small !...so now my item one side is not working,4
"It's nice for listening music and watching videos... Have nice amount of battery time and also quick charging with a c port charging case... Audio is mainly trebled and average bass..
Some issues I found is that it's actually hard to fit in ear due to its design and it starts paining after hrs of use...if u r a gamer, I wouldn't recommend buying this specially for BGMI and other fps games...it's latency is 60ms, still it's a big gap for a fps game and u will be killed even before hearing the ...",4
"The product was literally awesome and at this point, I liked the Design and build quality and at last the sound quality was really good.

Pros:-
1. Good build quality
2. Good sound and average quality of bass
3. Battery backup is also good

Cons:-
1. It will hurt your ear after 1 hour of playback
2. Calling audio is not good

My opinion:-
At this budget, you can purchase it for average use and cannot use for calling.",4

"Not user friendly, though the battery and display is good. But the user interface is not friendly at all, the charger received along with the mobile is the size of a fist, so when you put it in the socket it covers the surrounding switches due to its size, so you can't switch them on....very pathetic design. Even the phone interface has many probs, also if you click a photograph instead of it showing on top in gallery, it goes down at the bottom. I don't know why many are raving about it.",2
Some keyboard buttons are not working and no customer care support from the first day.,2

"Touch sensitivity is extremely poor and I have to press and hold hard at times to get the screen's attention. This being one of my important criteria for performance, I am rating this laptop low.

On the other hand, the laptop boots up within 7 seconds and shuts off within 2 seconds - this is really fast.

"Not user friendly, though the battery and display is good. But the user interface is not friendly at all, the charger received along with the mobile is the size of a fist, so when you put it in the socket it covers the surrounding switches due to its size, so you can't switch them on....very pathetic design. Even the phone interface has many probs, also if you click a photograph instead of it showing on top in gallery, it goes down at the bottom. I don't know why many are raving about it.",2
Some keyboard buttons are not working and no customer care support from the first day.,2

"Touch sensitivity is extremely poor and I have to press and hold hard at times to get the screen's attention. This being one of my important criteria for performance, I am rating this laptop low.

On the other hand, the laptop boots up within 7 seconds and shuts off within 2 seconds - this is really fast.

"The design and build quality seems premium. The size is smaller than average laptops as it is 14inch. Note that it is made in China, although the brand is of Hong Kong.

The keyboard is very easy to use and spacious. Track pad is good but the trackpad buttons sometimes need to be pressed 2-3 times to click.

Same goes for the power button, it never turns on in a single press. The power button light is also blue which for me is very difficult to notice. It should have been normal white light.

As the charger adapter has only two pin and no third pin, which is for earthing. So whenever you charge this device there is little current passing through entire body of laptop since the laptop is fully metal (aluminium) and I just don't feel right charging the device like this.

I had made a replacement and the new piece also has the same issue. I'm sure many others would have noticed. It's very negligible like an earth shock but still a defect nonetheless. When you have kids around it would be a concern to keep using it. Otherwise it's a great value for money product. Love the rest of it.",3
