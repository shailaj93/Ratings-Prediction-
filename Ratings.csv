"This is a very good smartphone, especially for students.
It has a very good camera and software optimisation. It has a '50 megapixel' camera. So you can click wide range photos very well. It is also very good for clicking photos of handwritten assignments. Selfie camera is ok.
It has a 'Helio G85' processor. For people who don't no much about processor, this is a very powerful and decent processor. You can run 'BGMI' and some other heavy games like this in good graphics settings very well.

"It is a redesigned narzo 20 with following differences.

Negative points-

They have removed gyroscope so you won't have functions like raise to wake screen and lift to pick up calls.You also won't get an ultra wide lens.

Build quality is slightly poorer than Narzo 20.

Positive Points-

On the plus side it has a much brighter screen (500 plus units compared to Narzo 20) a slightly better main camera as it has 50 MP main lens with a dedicated depth senor for potrait mode

Realme accidentally added an extra 0 in front of 5. Making it 50MP instead of 5MP. Front camera also not good. I am using realme phones since laat 4 years , cameras are always their major buying point, but narzo 50a has it as a greatest drawback.

Pathetic phone. Very very slow. Unable to receive a call if you are using any application. It will display the caller details after a few seconds of ringing. Worst wifi adapter. You cannot focus a point touching once. Atleast you have to tap 4-5 times minimum. You cannot view the photo you clicked just now. For that you also have to tap for a few times and also it will take some time to display the photo. Touch is bogus. PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. It is just wastage of money. I am trying ...,1

But the user interface is not friendly at all, the charger received along with the mobile is the size of a fist, so when you put it in the socket it covers the surrounding switches due to its size, so you can't switch them on....very pathetic design. Even the phone interface has many probs, also if you click a photograph instead of it showing on top in gallery, it goes down at the bottom. I don't know why many are raving about it.",2

✨Display - Best
✨Build - best in this segment ( except ports )
✨Battery backup : 6 - 8 hours for normal usage in 80% brightness with WiFi
✨ Fan noise almost equal to zero as mentioned by company
✨ For students its specifications are more than enough
✨ Windows 11 runs very smoothly on i3 10th gen also

Let's see how is the infinix after sale service !",5
"First of all the design is superb. Its compact and looks sturdy. The body gives the feeling of a premium laptop.
The display is excellent. 100% sRGB with 300nits brightness. Not even the top laptop brands are giving that in this price range.
Keyboard is OK with backlit. The backlit is not even through out but it's justifiable.
Speakers are really loud. You won't have any problem in watching movies. Listening to music is another joy.
Battery is superb. I used the laptop for more than 4hrs and ...",5

This price point 👉 good 👍❤️",5
"The design and build quality seems premium. The size is smaller than average laptops as it is 14inch. Note that it is made in China, although the brand is of Hong Kong.

The keyboard is very easy to use and spacious. Track pad is good but the trackpad buttons sometimes need to be pressed 2-3 times to click.

Same goes for the power button, it never turns on in a single press. The power button light is also blue which for me is very difficult to notice. It should have been normal white light.

The performance is as expected from an i3 although in benchmark score there isn't much difference from an older i5 small thing like WiFi speed app opening times and animations are all slow in this which you would notice if you are coming from a ryzen 5 or i5

But I love this laptop because the display and the touch and feel the privacy switch the big battery a clean windows is with no bloatware and decent enough performance.

You ca...",5
"They not provide the support we have face some problem in our system. I have tried to contact for support in Infinix official website. But we are not able to reach to support team.

So my concern is this product is good and also very good design and worth for money. But after purchase definitely we need service provider or support contact.

If you have near by infinix service center you can purchase this product 👍.",3

It's a good product for student . it's is so compact and easy to carry . With this window 11 support is also good .

I had made a replacement and the new piece also has the same issue. I'm sure many others would have noticed. It's very negligible like an earth shock but still a defect nonetheless. When you have kids around it would be a concern to keep using it. Otherwise it's a great value for money product. Love the rest of it.",3

Got this in rs 51839",5
The look of the design is very good and the keyboard can be easily used at night due to backlight keyboard. Performance is also very good and it takes only 4-5 seconds to reboot. The only thing I'm not satisfied with this laptop is the camera. Camera is very poor. It should have been more better since realme is a good brand. If brand like realme doesn't provide better camera then what people would rate about this brand in terms of Camera quality.,5
Overall good.as they said 11 hrs battery it not comming 11 hrs.. battery 🔋 is very bas..afteer i use 2months i am giving this rating..Go for other laptops which u know.. waste of mone friends,1

"Bought just three days ago. Looks okay. Light weight, good display, bigger keyboard buttons. 1TB hard disk in this price. overall great. However, If Asus can reduce the size which will look attractive, whole plastics is been used instead if they could have used metal, that would be essential. In India we all need low cost laptops for school or small business purpose. And a one more feature essential can make this laptop popular is the backlights in the keyboard.

No company pays attention to ...",3

"Pathetically slow.. You can't even operate MS Excel. Can't even open paint and paste your screenshot. I thought of upgrading the processor but it's non removable. I regret for every rupee wasted on it. I was happy that it felt so light weighted to hold, only to realize there is nothing inside 😅 I request Asus to stop it's production, I guess Asus is pushing unsold decades old Intel Celeron processors. But it's absolute waste of customer's money.

DON'T BUY!",1

The User Interface is clean and doesn't lags while operating the tv. Also, the picture quality is up to my expectations.

The after-sales is also great. I got my TV installed by a guy named Sonu from Jeeves. He was highly professional and explained all the features of the TV.",5

Generally 1plus is a good brand but even at a price of 16k OnePlus cannot afford to give such third grade products. Probably they should take this product off from circulation. Such pathetic was the quality of this particular product. Am not sure about how is the performance of higher end products in OnePlus but this definitely is not something to consider at all.,1

Picture quality average. Blur and looks like 3rd class display. Even crt tv has better display. I recommand lg or samsung.
You can't cast your mobile. It is very difficult to connect. There is no screen cast option in tv.
If anyhow you cast your screen then it lags very much.
Tv hangs frequently.

Installation is not free. Technician takes 400 rs for installation but other companies take no charges.

Pros:
Remote solves all your needs.
Connectivity us good.
Almost all apps are pre-installed.
4k picture quality is damn good.

Con:
There is no 3.5 audio output to connect your TV into an old sound system; one needs to buy an optical cable and optical to analogue converter in order to utilise an existing stereo system. And it's costs you dearly...rs 3.5k to 6k.

Please dont buy. This is terrible at what matters most - picture quality. A cheap Chinese Akiva has better vision quality..

The menu layout and navigation is terrible as well.
You have to press multiple keya to access display.

"Terrible picture quality - do not buy

Please dont buy. This is terrible at what matters most - picture quality. A cheap Chinese Akiva has better vision quality..
This is hd ready, not full hd.
I missed that while purchasing.

Sound is bad too.
The menu layout and navigation is terrible as well.
You have to press multiple keya to access display.
If you are changing display settings, you can't see realtime feedback !

Do not go buy the reviews posted here.",1

Tv is avrage. Operation is fast.. one thing i dont like in this tv is the bluetooth connectivity is very poor.when i connect it with my jbl soundbar through bluetooh the sound output is very bad. Only optical connectivity for auxiliary audio system. Startup is very slow..,4
"1) Sound & Picture Quality are Good

Bad Points

3) Charges Are Applied For Fixing On wall mount
4) TV is not worth For Money

"I bought this TV on 8th January 2021, next day delivery and installation was done... Kudos for service for Flipkart... The two stars are for that only...
But after that.... In just 8 days the TV started giving problems. I had connected my DTH with HDMI port. The picture of the DTH channels was distorted... I called for replacement as it was only 8 days.... The technician came next day... He did a factory reset and the DTH service started working.... He said there was problem with Ram..
Howeve...",1

"Just i would like to say under such price you are getting:-

1)A brand i.e, OnePlus.
2)Better picture quality provided that the connectivity is excellent.
3) Boder less design, which impersonate well itself.
4) Thick varients is also good.
5)Sound qualify is not much enough, for better experience you need to have sound theatre.

6)Thanx all from Alam.

"Team, Today only I received my product - 29, May, and below are pros and cons.

Good Point:
1. Very quick delivery
2. Better clarity compare to Mi and UV
3. Easy to handle and lightweight just 6 Kgs

Bad Points:
1. Not having AUX sound connectivity, it has Digital Optical Audio Output which is mostly not available with general sound system
2. difficult to share the mobile screen with this TV since OnePlus connect android App don't work on all mobiles
3. The Installation team will come after 8...",1
Bad quality.in 15 days so far display problem nd told me not replace tv. I told people not buying any electronics equipment from online.,1
"Within 4 months pitcher panal is not working properly, Engineer is come and check but last 10 days haven't received any response or solution, west of money, don't bye this product",1
My led tv picture suddenly off,1
"Recently I bought this tv...only one day it was worked,aftr that the display (picture was not displayed) was gone..I don't knw what happdn...I think it's not worthble yr",1
"This is sub standard TV. I have TCL TV purchased last yr. With same confirmation and clearly TCL is much much better.

Drawback..
1. Slow connectivity via wifi
2. USB. No last memory. Every time ull have forward which is very very slow
3. Picture clarity stands no where when compared with TCL
4. Screen cast/ mirroring is pathetic. It just keeps hanging.

Overall... its frustrating experience.

Go for TCL instead of One+",1
"Review after 9 months-
Black cloudy pattern on screen.

Poor customer support. I have following for last 2 months.

Don’t buy this product.",1
One plus to improve display panel quality...,1
"I am Changing my review almost after 11months of use as TV show sign of picture tube fading & even after 4complaints to customer care, no body shows up till now in more than 17days. Can see the sides of picture dosplay turning red & fading up.
Worst customer care service & worst after sale service. Will suggest not to buy one plus TVs at all if you want to save your hard earned money. Literally feeling cheated",1
Just amazing 👏,1
"TV quality is not a good, sound issues and TV is also hang many time Technics come and problem solve but next day problem re create....such a bad TV...I am really told you don't purchase this tv and don't waste your money for One+....Baddd",1
"Within 3 months of purchase, the display is gone. And its been 2 weeks since filing complaint under warranty, they have not been able to find & install new display. Don't recommend anyone to purchase this TV",1
Installation is an issue.,1
Automatically exit to home screen and off,1
"The worst tv everseen,, waste of time,, i would like to give my two suggestion to all
1)picture clarity of this tv is totally waste, myself giving input - movie 12GB size movie, but the output in the tv is 400mb movie size clarity,,
2) The speaker quality is really worst, voice clarity is as childish one having 5 to 7 years baby voice. Bluetooth speaker (cost may be Rs.250) is better than this tv spaeker. I request you to provide atleast Bluetooth spaeker quality,,, waste of money",1
It's very bad don't buy.... picture clarity worst very bad,1
Generally 1plus is a good brand but even at a price of 16k OnePlus cannot afford to give such third grade products. Probably they should take this product off from circulation. Such pathetic was the quality of this particular product. Am not sure about how is the performance of higher end products in OnePlus but this definitely is not something to consider at all.,1
Horrible product...unnatural colours... Most of the STB channels are blurr ..Picture quality is too bad...do not recommend this product to anyone ...complete waste of money,1
"Very poor display. It gives eye strains and headaches.
The colours looks faded and the sharpness is too high.
It is pinching to the eyes.
never expected such a poor product from 1+
Moreover the flipkart refuses to return it.
Be extremely cautious before buying.
I will not recommend it at all.
I feel like being cheated.",1

Great earpods with amazing bass. Loved the ergonomic design that fits into my small ears. Thank you flipkart.,5

"Good sound (Though Bass can be worked on a bit) and amazing connectivity with android and ios phones. I tried on both devices and i am using it with iphone7. Best part is battery - so far so good, once fully charged case can be on till 2-3 days which is amazing.",5

I have been using this gearpod for more than 1 month

Pros:-
1) Good noise cancellation , it does have a snug fit to the ear so it stays in place(need to put ear-tips that fit your ear).

2) Good vocals, crisp sound, decent bass. No lag in latency during movies or songs.

It's sound quality is perfect ...but bass is good .. not perfect...we can enjoy music with great sound of good bass...u can have a try on it...if it gets at low price rate .. and also it's touch controls are also good and accurate...well made... simply perfect...but it can be much better if it have that punchy bass ... overall a nice product...thank u",4
So Here we go the product design is awesome !! You can wear and do gym ! The calling feature is nice but as compare to boat its bass is not that good but u will be satisfied at this price the touching sensor is fast the battery backup is awesome...it would have been awesome if there would be more bass.. All over a good purchase at this price ! And yes at the last the case is so compact and small !...so now my item one side is not working,4
"It's nice for listening music and watching videos... Have nice amount of battery time and also quick charging with a c port charging case... Audio is mainly trebled and average bass..
Some issues I found is that it's actually hard to fit in ear due to its design and it starts paining after hrs of use...if u r a gamer, I wouldn't recommend buying this specially for BGMI and other fps games...it's latency is 60ms, still it's a big gap for a fps game and u will be killed even before hearing the ...",4
"The product was literally awesome and at this point, I liked the Design and build quality and at last the sound quality was really good.

Pros:-
1. Good build quality

Cons:-
1. It will hurt your ear after 1 hour of playback

I have used these gearpods for 6 months They were performing well but now the left gearpod has a very low sound and the touch in pad click by itself and restart the music without clicking it,4
It's affordable,4
Its good one for hear music and not ok for speak,4
The product is good not excellent. The build quality of the product is not so good but the bass and sound propagation quality is great according to the price range. The most highlighting part is that it has longer battery life than any other earbuds according to the budget.,4

I am not really happy with this product.The amount of time that it takes is really troubles a lot as its taking 4 hrs to fully charged. I will not prefer anyone to buy this product if they are looking for a quick charging product.,2

"Camera is not good, remaining all is medium not up to the mark as given by them in specification.",2
Not happy,2
"Not user friendly, though the battery and display is good. But the user interface is not friendly at all, the charger received along with the mobile is the size of a fist, so when you put it in the socket it covers the surrounding switches due to its size, so you can't switch them on....very pathetic design. Even the phone interface has many probs, also if you click a photograph instead of it showing on top in gallery, it goes down at the bottom. I don't know why many are raving about it.",2
Some keyboard buttons are not working and no customer care support from the first day.,2
Those claims of battery backup upto 13 hours is completely fake as it merely stands for 5 hours for normal videoplayback,2
Not good,2
"I3 haven't back-lit feature in keyboard , but they give that in specification.....",2

100% waste product.",2
"Touch sensitivity is extremely poor and I have to press and hold hard at times to get the screen's attention. This being one of my important criteria for performance, I am rating this laptop low.

On the other hand, the laptop boots up within 7 seconds and shuts off within 2 seconds - this is really fast. The low weight (about 1.2 kgs) and long battery (9+ hrs on full charge) will make this a perfect tool for any sales guy willing to show customers slides or calculations instantly. There is ...",2

But the user interface is not friendly at all, the charger received along with the mobile is the size of a fist, so when you put it in the socket it covers the surrounding switches due to its size, so you can't switch them on....very pathetic design. Even the phone interface has many probs, also if you click a photograph instead of it showing on top in gallery, it goes down at the bottom. I don't know why many are raving about it.",2

On the other hand, the laptop boots up within 7 seconds and shuts off within 2 seconds - this is really fast.

I am not really happy with this product.The amount of time that it takes is really troubles a lot as its taking 4 hrs to fully charged. I will not prefer anyone to buy this product if they are looking for a quick charging product.,2

Not happy,2
"Not user friendly, though the battery and display is good. But the user interface is not friendly at all, the charger received along with the mobile is the size of a fist, so when you put it in the socket it covers the surrounding switches due to its size, so you can't switch them on....very pathetic design. Even the phone interface has many probs, also if you click a photograph instead of it showing on top in gallery, it goes down at the bottom. I don't know why many are raving about it.",2
Some keyboard buttons are not working and no customer care support from the first day.,2
Those claims of battery backup upto 13 hours is completely fake as it merely stands for 5 hours for normal videoplayback,2
Not good,2

100% waste product.",2
"Touch sensitivity is extremely poor and I have to press and hold hard at times to get the screen's attention. This being one of my important criteria for performance, I am rating this laptop low.

On the other hand, the laptop boots up within 7 seconds and shuts off within 2 seconds - this is really fast. The low weight (about 1.2 kgs) and long battery (9+ hrs on full charge) will make this a perfect tool for any sales guy willing to show customers slides or calculations instantly. There is ...",2

"The design and build quality seems premium. The size is smaller than average laptops as it is 14inch. Note that it is made in China, although the brand is of Hong Kong.

The keyboard is very easy to use and spacious. Track pad is good but the trackpad buttons sometimes need to be pressed 2-3 times to click.

Same goes for the power button, it never turns on in a single press. The power button light is also blue which for me is very difficult to notice. It should have been normal white light.

"No doubt the laptop is little above average. It is very good value for money.

Let me share what are the cons of this device.

1. The biggest issue with the device is, power leaking.

As the charger adapter has only two pin and no third pin, which is for earthing. So whenever you charge this device there is little current passing through entire body of laptop since the laptop is fully metal (aluminium) and I just don't feel right charging the device like this.

I had made a replacement and the new piece also has the same issue. I'm sure many others would have noticed. It's very negligible like an earth shock but still a defect nonetheless. When you have kids around it would be a concern to keep using it. Otherwise it's a great value for money product. Love the rest of it.",3

"It's been almost 6 month since I got this laptop. Initially it was great. But lately the battery has been discharging way too quickly, even within 2 hours from 100%.

Only draw back is the software update is not so well maintained for this device. I mean i updated to Windows 11 through general channel. But it contains the same bugs from Windows insider beta channel. So what is the difference between two updates? Otherwise this is a very good laptop,3
"Not performing as expected. Serious problems, I too felt that nee brands should be given a chance and so in that feeling I tried this.

Pros:
1. Form factor,
2. Fast charging
3. Display
4. Performance
Cons:
1. Avg battery life
2. Sometimes laptop is freezing and cursor isn't coming up, no matter what is done, it's not getting normal.",3
Product is good. But no GST credit available.,3

Cheap material used. Display, not so good quality. Screen can't bend more than 120 degree. It's not even 180. So don't expect 360.

Rest my priority was different. I wanted good looking white laptop. So I did sasti masti. I am happy with it. Rest if u want value for money, then it is not for u.",3

"Bought just three days ago. Looks okay. Light weight, good display, bigger keyboard buttons. 1TB hard disk in this price. overall great. However, If Asus can reduce the size which will look attractive, whole plastics is been used instead if they could have used metal, that would be essential. In India we all need low cost laptops for school or small business purpose. And a one more feature essential can make this laptop popular is the backlights in the keyboard.
